"""Maya's ``// Error:`` messages for commands run on a selection they don't take (step 258, #152).

Maya prints these as Errors in the Command Line / Help Line (Maya 2026,
with the step-258 additions there). A kit operator reports one with ``op.report({'ERROR'}, text)``;
code that runs a Blender operator for a Maya menu item raises ``MayaError`` before it, which the menu item turns into
the same Error report (``report_nested``) instead of Blender's Python error.
